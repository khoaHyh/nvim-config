# Neovim config

My personal Neovim confguration that _shouldn't_ break often.

### Want to try this config?

Clone this repository and move it to your config path which usually should be at `~/.config`. Make sure to rename
the directory from `nvim-config` to `nvim`.

**Optional**

If you have your own dotfiles directory and would like to maintain a copy of your config while
also using it you can use a sym link.

```sh
ln -s /path/to/target_directory /path/to/symlink_directory

-- Example: here the original directory lives at ~/dev/dotfiles/.config/nvim and we are
-- creating a symbolic link at the path ~/.config/nvim
ln -s ~/dev/dotfiles/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim
```
